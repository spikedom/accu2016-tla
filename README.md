## [Test Driven Specification - A Gentle Introduction to TLA+](http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2016/accu2016_sessions#Test_Driven_Specification_%E2%80%93_A_Gentle_Introduction_to_TLA+_(finding_concurrency_bugs_before_you_write_code))

This is an introduction to the Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA+), the system for specifying concurrent systems invented by Turing Award winner Leslie Lamport.

In this session I will demonstrate the use of TLA+ and TLC (the TLA+ model checker) to develop a specification for, and explore the properties of, a concurrent system.

I will show how an interactive test driven approach can be used both to learn TLA+, and to incrementally build a specification for a concurrent system.

You will see how the development of a specification can be guided in simple steps by tests, whilst the TLA+ tools expose flaws that violate requirements or cause the system to deadlock.

TLA+ and the TLA+ Tools, including TLC, are [available](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tla.html) from Microsoft Research under an MIT license.
